## Points to consider 🐱
> ✅ The cat will move every day we open a box, if we start from box 1, and check that box n times, the cat will move n times.<br>
> ✅ The cat will always move to 1 adjacent box. <br>


## Proposal :octocat:
> Create an algorithm that iterates n times over the first index, n being the length of our array. <br>
> Example: If we have an array of 5 elements/boxes we will check over the first box for 5 days, generating 5 movements on the cat
